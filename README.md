# Prewlett_Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the analysis was conducted to provide Pwelett Hackard with the information on the future number of retirees from each departments currently working at the company. It was conducted to asses what areas needs to be filled with what positions, to be prepared to fill the vacancies with the appropriate personnel internal/external candidates. The criteria was on birth dates ranging from 1952-1955 and hire dates of 1985-1988.
## Results
- The picture below shows the number number of employees based on the job title. It can be seen that the number one title is Senior Engineers, which is 29414 staff members, or it can be seen as 64%. Senior engineers require experience, tenure, and skillsets that require large amount of time in order to be in that position. The company should definitely be well prepared to fill the vacancies.

## Summary
There is a large number of Senior Engineer positions that are coming close to their retirement. 64% is a very large number, which is also an alarming notice for the company to start and look for the eligible candidates within the company and ensuring that they will get appropriate timing and training that is necessary to move into the senior roles. I would recommmend the company to do the necessary sourcing beginning now, prepare job postings and gather the recruiting team members to hone in on what job titles will needs to be filled by prioritization.
